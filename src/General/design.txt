1. Visibility of System Status

Explanation: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, 
through appropriate feedback.
Example: Showing a loading spinner when data is being fetched or a progress bar 
during file upload.

2. Match Between System and the Real World
Explanation: The interface should speak the users’ language, using words, 
phrases, and concepts that are familiar to the user, rather than technical jargon. 
Follow real-world conventions to make the experience intuitive.

Example: Using icons like a trash can to signify "delete" or a floppy disk for "save."

3. User Control and Freedom
Explanation: Users often perform actions by mistake. 
The interface should provide “emergency exits” like undo or redo options, 
and confirmation dialogs to prevent errors.

Example: A button to cancel or undo actions like deleting a file or sending an email.
